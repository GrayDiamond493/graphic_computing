# Shirt Store
**This problem is entirely academic and not to be deployed in an industrial environment**

This application allows the user to store shirt measures and generate a shirt silhouette based on said measures. 

## Installation
All Libraries used are native to the language.
Since this is a web application, you should only need to run it in a browser. 

There are many options to run it in a local server, be it Apache web server packages sush as [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html), [WampServer]https://www.wampserver.com/en/() or others alike.
For simplicity, you can also try opening from the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) Extension from Visual Studio Code. 

No further installations needed.

## User Instructions

The graphic user interface will ask the user for 4 measures for their shirt (hip,length,width,back) assumed in centimeters. Then, after pressing the **See my shirt!** button, a shirt with said measures should be visible.

The **Translate** section allows to move the shirt up, down, left and right, where the arrow button points.
The **Escalate** section allows to alter the shirt's size, bigger or smaller.
The **Rotate** section allows to rotate the shirt clockwise or counter-clockwise.
